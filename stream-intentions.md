# Stream intentions 2020

## PTO investigations

The week of Feb 24 to 29 is the week off to breath, think deep, and consider our options.

- [ ] Figure out PTO stream schedule (among other adulting catch-up things)

Each day for 3 to 4 hours is doable
Not the normal schedule, let's experiment



- [x] iCS subription (and sync)
- [x] security, specifically around MFA, and how api keys are handled
- [x] Investigate the "get stuff" api
- [x] [Configure localhost with SSL](https://dev.to/kauresss/2-minute-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-localhost-5817)
- [x] How fast can I pump "stuff" into a "base" (50 records per second)

Looks like there is no native graphql endpoint, so we can make our own with blackjack and hookers:

## Q1

**Note:** At time of writing there are only 6 weeks left in Q1

The Q1 intention is to define what technologies we really want to work on
Hardware and software
I have a conference, that is pressing

- Slides, POCs, order hardware, write hardware code (python, C)
- Soldering, assembly, shock/travel testing for the hardware
- Talk-focusing (Guard duty, what do we fake vs live demo)
- Practicing, promoting, publishing code, prepping the travel bag
- Twilio dev fits in here somewhere? But it's only 1/3 of the notification mechanisms I want to use

I also have some work "figure it outs"

And I'm now a twilio champion

- I doubt I can travel to the May 28th conference
- So maybe we put of the twilio IoT stuff for later
- There are 2 kits, $99/$29 one for 3g, one for narrowband?
- We would have to buy those, do a thing, and that's too late for the conference

Merch store? Exploratory
Amazon Affiliate, mandatory
Embed Airtable Calendar in Twitch Panel?

## Q2

Ends July 1st
First good weather quarter

Goals:

Twilio IoT example, grove board, sensors, something
Flesh out channel rewards, community-driven
Stream design refresh

## Q3

Ends Sept 1st

Goals:

We have at least one better top-down camera and mount for one thing
I would like to have it dual-purpose the top-down on the main stream/code, and also be the hardware cam
This is usually around the time that some charity things kick off, should we participate?
Also last good-weather quarter


## Q4

Ends Dec 31st

Goals:

Holiday special
Year-end wrapup video
Blooper reel
By this point we are going to want a good system for sending OUT perk packages to subs (or other?)
