# Stream notes July 23, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Some show and tell
- [x] Stream review, some introspection, and a path forward
- [x] Recent contribution
- [ ] DO THE THING
- [x] Retrospective
- [x] Raid and publish

## Goals

- [x] Consensus on the forward goals
- [x] Alignment on why I would do this
- [ ] Fly a kite all the way to prod (with dev)
- [ ] Issues for feature requests, help me help you
- [x] Vaction week expectations

## What did we learn

- Plenty of interest in docker-centric learning
- We fixed a path mistake, but identified a bad pattern in the first place
- Just having a discord call-in can alleviate a lot of confusion!

## Next steps

- Fix up PR, get it merged in

## Meta

- PR took a bit longer than expected due to a path mistake
- Changes were well-received, and faster build times confirmed
