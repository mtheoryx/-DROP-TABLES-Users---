# Stream notes July 27, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Intro, review last Silicon Saturday progress and next steps
- [x] Stream improvements and this week's upcoming news
- [x] DO THE THING
- [x] Retrospective
- [x] Raid

## Goals

- [x] Test possibility of siphoning power from Rhonda
- [x] How do we program one strip, multiple segments
- [ ] Can using multiple controllers be better?

## What did we learn

- 3.3v at even 100 bright white causes a redshift
- You have to initialize the entire strip, even if you want to program a portion of the leds
- Particle workbench needs told what .ino files to build in the project

## Next steps

- Program different effects for the other 2 sets of leds on the array
- Research better cylon effect
- Test underglow effects
- Find a camera spot and layout to show rhonda (rhonda cam) on a dark background that allows some movement (floor preferrably)
